#### ENG 2, SOFTWARE DEV â€¢ COMCAST- Xmidt/Webpa, PHILADELPHIAâ€¢ MARCH 2022 â€“ Current
â€¢ Golang backend developer for highly scalable opensource IoT management related softwares such as xmidt, webpa, codex

#### ENG 2, SOFTWARE DEV & ENGINEERING, MACHINE LEARNINGâ€¢ COMCAST- DATA NETWORK SERVICES & PRODUCTS, PHILADELPHIAâ€¢ JAN 2019 â€“ MARCH 2022
â€¢ Developer lead for the inner-source AMP project, a ML platform for ML application
development & orchestration
â€¢ Data science lead for the virtual service gateway (VSG) usage anomaly detection project, used to detect usage byte counting anomalies of cm/cmts/vsg and later expanding the solution to detect anomalies/major deviations in dscp usage/ip family usage
â€¢ Designed and implemented a scalable monitoring tool for Comcastâ€™s business and residential voice servicesâ€™ application servers using SNMP Trap data

#### ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY INTERN, MACHINE LEARNINGâ€¢ COMCAST- NETWORK SERVICE & ANALYSIS, PHILADELPHIAâ€¢ MAY 2017 â€“ DECEMBER 2018
â€¢ Developed a ML application that detects real-time network anomalies, abnormal packet loss,
between Data-Centers and Cloud-RAN using IP SLA probe data
â€¢ Developed a tool that analyzes Comcastâ€™s backbone health and predicts several network anomalies 5 minutes in advance with high precision and recall using WLA2 probe data

#### COMPUTER VISION RESEARCH ASSISTANT â€¢ DR. RICHARD SOUVENIR, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHIAâ€¢ JAN 2017 â€“ FEB 2020
â€¢ Developed algorithms/architectures to better understand human driving behaviors and the
impact of low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles within our society
â€¢ Assisted with the advanced study of multi-target tracking algorithms and effectively analyzed large amounts of motion data collected from a variety of sensors
â€¢ Developed algorithms for large-scale tracking and group behavior and that allowed domain scientists to analyze large amounts of motion and behavioral data to find activities of interest
